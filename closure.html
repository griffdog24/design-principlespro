     <h1>Closure</h1>
     <p>“We mentally fill in the gaps in order to complete a perceived shape. The idea of designing with only a part but having your viewer perceive the whole opens up interesting compositional opportunities, including the interplay of positive and negative space.”(pp.62) </p>
     <p>Readers have the ability to finish certain things in a picture or text without realizing it. That’s something the human brain does; it recognizes something within an object and finishes what should or could be there. That is helpful in design, because it means you can create simpiler websites and still get your meaning across.</p>

    <p>This door ends your movement along with the path you see ahead of you. If there are no more seats in Cassel, the doors close keeping students who didn't pay from getting to the game. In life doors are constantly shut, halting people from continuing on their path creating closure of their adventure. </p>
