     <h1>Rhythm</h1>
     <p>“A pattern, whether regular or irregular, also may create a sort of movement we could call rhythm. Think of music, foot tapping, finger snapping, clapping and dancing. In graphic design, rhythmic movement has to do with repeating items strategically kind of like a backbeat.”(pp.59)  </p>
    <p>Something that creates a structure between the website’s pictures and words. It makes a pattern within the website that makes it more pleasing to the reader and easier to follow.</p>

    <p>There are patterns and rhythms everywhere in everyday life. This is just one example of students and fans creating a pattern to create an epic looking stadium. Patterns make a lot of sense to the human brain. Your brain sees a pattern and understands what it is looking at more because of the rhythm of the object.</p>
