     <h1>Proximity!</h1>
     <p>“We perceive objects that are close together as belonging to the same group. A related law, the law of Common Fate, says that we perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group.”(pp.60) </p>
    <p>Within the website the things that are similar or belong together must be close within the page. It makes it easier on the readers and shows them the topic of discussion for that page or part of the page.</p>

    <p>At Virginia Tech, the campus is split in two sides, Academic and Living areas. These dorm buildings were built together because they are all buildings for students to live in. They were built in this way, because it seemed logical to put people in the same boat together because it will make them feel a sense of unity.</p>
