     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p>“The last principle, unity, may seem a little abstract compared to the other five perspectives. Unity means that all the parts of the design work together, and everything looks like it belongs together.”(pp.60) </p>
    <p>In the end the most important thing about the website is cohesiveness. The structure and outline must all work together in order to make a well-rounded website that grabs the viewers’ attention and makes them pay attention. That creates unity as everything looks and seems to fit together.</p>

    <p>As a student at Virginia Tech, I feel unified constantly with my peers. This is just one example, as the Virginia Tech team plays a game, you can see almost the entire stadium is dressed in white. This is supposed to support our football team and show our university as one strong unit.</p>
