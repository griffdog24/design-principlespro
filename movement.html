     <h1>Movement</h1>
     <p>“The principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design controls the eyes flow through the composition. The flow of lines can move the eye across the page or screen.”(pp.57) </p>
    <p>An act of changing or developing yourself or an object. Something that brings attention to the audience and guides them through the pages.</p>

    <p>Whenever I'm at the gym playing basketball there is constant movement. Not only of the ball, but of players bodies, their eyes, their minds. Athletes are constantly moving in many ways in order to, pass, shoot, rebound, and win. There are an infinite amount of movements by different people and objects throughout the entire game. </p>
