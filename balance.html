     <p>“In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radial, symmetrical and asymmetrical.”(pp.56) </p>
    <p>Balance is two or more things that must be equal. An even distribution between objects to make something seem more appealing. It also creates a sense of completion.</p>

       <p>This sign has a rainbow affect with two colors that blend well together creating balance between them. Neither color looks like the focal point which means there is balance between them. They have visual equality and thus are balanced.</p>
